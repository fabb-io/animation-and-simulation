3D single player videogame in unity

I approached for the first time the creation of a 'videogame', I managed to learn the process of making a videogame.
We focused on the main mechanics that we needed and studied in the subject, not caring too much on the visual aspects.

Here the link to the files(the project are heavy and git is giving me trouble uploading them):

If you're trying to use our project:
the main function are the shooting system and the seft controlled Ai-enemies,
main buttons for movement are WASD and SPACE for jumping,
for the shooting and movement direction you'll use the mouse axis and MOUSE1 and MOUSE2,
there a lot of mechanics and I hope you'll fell courious to discover them.
