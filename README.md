3D single player videogame in unity

I approached for the first time the creation of a 'videogame', I managed to learn the process of making a videogame.
We focused on the main mechanics that we needed and studied in the subject, not caring too much on the visual aspects.

If you're trying to use our project:
the main function are the shooting system and the seft controlled Ai-enemies,
main buttons for movement are WASD and SPACE for jumping,
for the shooting and movement direction you'll use the mouse axis and MOUSE1 and MOUSE2,
there a lot of mechanics and I hope you'll fell courious to discover them.
